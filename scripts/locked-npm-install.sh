# This script should be used instead of `npm install` in the project for security reasons.
# The script checks if `npm install` changed the package-lock.json file, this way
# it verifies that all the downloaded dependencies are of the versions we expect they have.
#
# Usage:
#
# From the root project directory call `scripts/locked-npm-install.sh`
#
# Return value:
# 
# Script returns 0 if all lock files are up to date, 1 otherwise.
